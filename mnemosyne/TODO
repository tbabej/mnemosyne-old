Mnemosyne 1.0.x series:

-add current card statistics to statistics dialog

-basic graphical statistics

-change file suffix when changing export format



Mnemosyne 1.1:


-benchmark SQLAlchemy and move to sqlite backend (encode card relations and
 tag hierarchy in name, multiple category fields per card)

-What to do with StartTime object?

-test database widget to see if we need Qt4 now. (Note: if the category is
 stored as a number, we probably do. If so, see if first updating to Qt4
 is a better incremental development policy.

-rename edit_items to knowledge manager, items to cards at the source level

-detect and mark inverses

-what if doing 'add vice versa' when the id is already '.inv'?

-update XML import/export to new database format

-make sure that reset learning data (both import and export) doesn't break
 the connection between cards.

-autosave

-make really sure the same question isn't asked twice in a row



Mnemosyne 1.2:

-Upgrade to Qt4

-front widget that allows copying, can produce scroll bars

-instead of QListview, use the model/view framework from Qt4 
 or database widget

-bug in Qt? : get rid of dummy '.' status tips

-bug in Qt? : shortcuts don't change back after changing 'show answer' 
 button text

-bug in Qt? : spaces around images are not respected.

-consistent editing of vice versa and three-sided cards



Mnemosyne 1.3:

-rename categories to tags?

-GUI support for multiple tags per card (Note: for tags relating
 to direction of card, we probably don't need to specify them explicitly,
 but can read them off the IDs.)



Mnemosyne 1.4

-synonym handling



Mnemosyne 1.5

-hierarchical tags

-advanced deck manager, with tree view of tags, drag and drop
 to change tags, count of items/facts...

-regular expression search?

-add 'add card' option to deck manager?



Mnemosyne 1.6

-plugin mechanism

-check out python eggs

-custom card types with custom fields, template for cards

-language specific card types (arabic, japanese, integrated dictionary lookup)

-make more publicity

-template expansion (disable add-vice-versa) ( both {../..} and {}..{})

-cloze deletion (disable add-vice-versa and template expansion)

-mnemosyne analysis as plugin



Miscellaneous

-tip of the day

-unify number shortcuts (with and without Ctrl)

-forward / backward when previewing cards in the database

-clean up interval when importing from txt

-USB key version as alternative for web based revision

-recreate user_id and log_index from files in history folder

-paste from clipboard

-drag and drop of pictures, sound files

-autoupgrade, or at least notify of available upgrade (needs a separate thread)

-mini toolbar for adding pictures and sounds

-remember window size set by the user?

-undo last grade + keyboard shortcut

-per category statistics in 'Activate categories'

-icon handling patch Dirk

-manual

-better sound replay support, through clicking on an icon

-option to type right answer

-integrate Mnemosyne analysis, advanced statistics, history, 
 forgetting index, histogram of grades and intervals... (look at graphs 
 in JMemorize)

-getting the last repetition of a card: 
 http://spyced.blogspot.com/2007/01/why-sqlalchemy-impresses-me.html

-eager loading / joins?

-importing cards from rss feed

-clean obsolete latex images / autogenerate them

-make <a> links clickable

-feedback about uploads in GUI / add time-out

-investigate ridiculously large thinking times

-animated GIFs

-DTD for xml format

-priorities for categories?

-determine import / export file type based on suffix 
 (i.e. remove file format field)? Probably not possible, as
 file dialogs only return filenames, not the chosen filter type.

-separate colors per category?

-unify save and export?

-clean duplicates for answers too?

-hints? separate mnemonics?

-corner case: If M > 0 and k < 0 then (a,b) is a local maximum
If M > 0 and k > 0 then (a,b) is a local minimum: eats < ... >



Far away:

-Windows Mobile port (PyQt, venster?, Tkinter?)

-foreign language text widget, integrated with online dict,
 easy creation of new cards



Superkaramba / Plasma

-Check Unicode

-set fonts, left align

-Allow clicking anywhere in the status window, rather than just on the
 text.

-Automatic detection of PyQt executable exit (bug in Superkaramba).
