* Miscellaneous:

-smarter sorting. See suggestios by larryrenslow

-natural sort order of categories which contain numbers (1 vs 01)

-auto identifying similar cards

-unify number shortcuts (with and without Ctrl)

-pop-up of context info

-forward / backward when previewing cards in the database

 T.<fixed card id for all pupils>.<pupil user id>

-better sound replay support, through clicking on an icon

-integrate Mnemosyne analysis, advanced statistics, history,
 forgetting index, histogram of grades and intervals... (look at graphs
 in JMemorize)

-importing cards from rss feed

-clean obsolete latex images / autogenerate them

-investigate ridiculously large thinking times

-DTD for xml format

-priorities for categories?

-determine import / export file type based on suffix
 (i.e. remove file format field)? Probably not possible, as
 file dialogs only return filenames, not the chosen filter type.

-unify save and export?

-hints? separate mnemonics?

-corner case: If M > 0 and k < 0 then (a,b) is a local maximum
If M > 0 and k > 0 then (a,b) is a local minimum: eats < ... >

Far away:

-foreign language text widget, integrated with online dict,
 easy creation of new cards



* Plasma widget:
