-option to detect and mark inverses on import?
-update XML import/export to new database format
-warn when importing card type with duplicate id
-option to add tags on import
-save import dir
-make sure enter does not close the import dialog
-make sure we log new card creation on import
-'teacher mode' on export, which allows pupils to update previously imported
 cards, as opposed to adding new cards. Implemented through id's of the form
 T.<fixed card id for all pupils>.<pupil user id>?
-when resetting learning data on export, can we export facts only? Tags are on
 a per card basis.
-make sure all grades are shown on first revision of imported card. Adapt button group title

-tips (both on startup and on use): right click to add cards or sound, comma to 
 separate tag names, :: to separate hierarchies
-comment/tip about not having to do all your scheduled repetitions in
 one sitting
-upgrade docs on duplicate checking
-update tooltips, inform Patrick

-sync protocol:
-deck name
-import

-test uploading of logs, also in rollover

-better mechanism to have different renderers

-see if graphical glitch is fixed with latest matplotlib version, reenable
 remember size

-make distrib

-check for related cards on same day could fail if minute level scheduler is used in the meantime
 (update comment in scheduler too)

-infrastructure to make it easier to type certain symbols

-mark cards plugin

-ampersand mnemonics everywhere

-partial implementation of type answer (none/all/special tag? Db Attribute? Button?)
-draw answer, make configurable by card type

-more plugin examples: file format, custom tag, activate all cards,
 last grade filter

-leech detection (mod 15)

-ask people about biggest gripe in Mnemosyne, things that did not behave as expected


-also add option to download source in the info box

-allow edit current card and add card to be open at the same time?

-make file handling more robust, detect all errors (see mail by
 OldGrantonian)

-centralise event type codes

-reenable datadir in setup.py

-make filters more efficients by using regex instead of loops.

-easier function to do tag detection in plugin

-bug in Qt: setting default colour to black does not register the colour clicks.

-document cntrl enter in edit dialog instead of clicking ok

* After 2.0:

-website redesign? like http://hanzim.com/download.php

-add days since last rep / until next rep to statistics

-don't activate plugins until after clicking ok

-respect font in fact editor

-card type with prefilled fields

-update ohloh?

-skritter/cpod interop mail

-better supermemo import

-get rid of mp3 clip prevention?

-plugin to store backups on dropbox

-detect wrong current date (last review in the future or way past)

-improve sphinxdocs: autoclass='both', document module members

-show latex errors in GUI?

-add media to a card but then abandonig/editing the card keeps the media in media directory
 (they are not referenced in the database, though)

-pythoscope? http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pythoscope/0.2.1
http://pythoscope.org/
-pyflakes?

-hover over extra hanzi information, hanzi statistics

Multiuser statistics analysis:

-break out card id stringss to a different table and use interger _id in the rest of
 the database to save space
-move times from a later start date to save space?
-investigate origin of ._ logs
-don't do card checks for post 2.0

-congratulations screen

-language text based card types, with 'graduating' from word cards once they are learned enough,
 and only keeping sentence cards (mail by querido, scheduler feedback needed)

-scheduler with minute granularity?


* Miscellaneous:

-change file suffix when changing export format

-button after opening fact editor in edit deck to go to next card in the list

-sound recorder

-store _fact_ids_learned in config, such that they persist over sessions?

-auto identifying similar cards

-unify number shortcuts (with and without Ctrl)

-forward / backward when previewing cards in the database

-clean up interval when importing from txt

-paste from clipboard

-font and color comboboxes instead of dialogs in card appearance?

-preselect all in some text fields, so that the users can start typing
 immediately

-feedback about uploads in GUI / add time-out

-drag and drop of pictures, sound files

-autoupgrade, or at least notify of available upgrade (needs a separate thread)

-bundle docs

-undo last grade + keyboard shortcut. Disable undo after logs have been purged

-http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2009/03/12/wysiwyg-html-editor/

-integrate Mnemosyne analysis, advanced statistics, history,
 forgetting index, histogram of grades and intervals... (look at graphs
 in JMemorize)

-importing cards from rss feed

-clean obsolete latex images / autogenerate them

-investigate ridiculously large thinking times

-determine import / export file type based on suffix
 (i.e. remove file format field)? Probably not possible, as
 file dialogs only return filenames, not the chosen filter type.

-swac plugin, smart.fm

-corner case: If M > 0 and k < 0 then (a,b) is a local maximum
If M > 0 and k > 0 then (a,b) is a local minimum: eats < ... >
