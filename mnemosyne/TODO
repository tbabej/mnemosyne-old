 button text

-bug in Qt? : spaces around images are not respected.

-does <p align="left"> work as advertised? Otherwise table tag.

-consistent editing of vice versa and three-sided cards

-option to type right answer

-remove 'check duplicates when adding' option?

-three sided export?



Mnemosyne 2.1:

-GUI support for multiple categories per card (Note: for categories relating
 to direction of card, we probably don't need to specify them explicitly,
 but can read them off the IDs.)



Mnemosyne 2.2

-synonym handling



Mnemosyne 2.3

-hierarchical categories

-advanced deck manager, with tree view, drag and drop to change categories, 
 count of cards/facts...

-regular expression search?

-add 'add card' option to deck manager?

-cloze deletion (disable add-vice-versa and template expansion)

-mnemosyne analysis as plugin

-save category state as plugin

-remap keys as plugin

-active alert as plugin



Miscellaneous

-unify number shortcuts (with and without Ctrl)

-forward / backward when previewing cards in the database

-clean up interval when importing from txt

-make file format strings translatable

-paste from clipboard

-preselect all in some text fields, so that the users can start typing
 immediately

-feedback about uploads in GUI / add time-out

-drag and drop of pictures, sound files

-autoupgrade, or at least notify of available upgrade (needs a separate thread)

-mini toolbar for adding pictures and sounds

-remember window size set by the user?

-undo last grade + keyboard shortcut

-icon handling patch Dirk

-manual

-better sound replay support, through clicking on an icon

-integrate Mnemosyne analysis, advanced statistics, history, 
 forgetting index, histogram of grades and intervals... (look at graphs 
 in JMemorize)

-importing cards from rss feed

-clean obsolete latex images / autogenerate them

-make <a> links clickable

-investigate ridiculously large thinking times

-animated GIFs

-DTD for xml format

-priorities for categories?

-determine import / export file type based on suffix 
 (i.e. remove file format field)? Probably not possible, as
 file dialogs only return filenames, not the chosen filter type.

-separate colors per category?

-unify save and export?

-clean duplicates for answers too?

-hints? separate mnemonics?

-corner case: If M > 0 and k < 0 then (a,b) is a local maximum
If M > 0 and k > 0 then (a,b) is a local minimum: eats < ... >



Far away:

-Windows Mobile port (PyQt, venster?, Tkinter?)

-foreign language text widget, integrated with online dict,
 easy creation of new cards



Superkaramba / Plasma

-Check Unicode

-set fonts, left align

-Allow clicking anywhere in the status window, rather than just on the
 text.

-Automatic detection of PyQt executable exit (bug in Superkaramba).
