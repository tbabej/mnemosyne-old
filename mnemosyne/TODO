* Create testsuite:

-create test for adding cards
-create test for detecting duplication
-pythoscope? http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pythoscope/0.2.1
http://pythoscope.org/
-pylint, pyflakes




* After 2.0:

-three sided export?

-option to type right answer

-synonym handling plugin?

-regular expression search?

-add 'add card' option to deck manager?

-template expansion (disable add-vice-versa) ( both {../..} and {}..{})

-cloze deletion card type

-mnemosyne analysis as plugin

-remap keys as plugin

-active alert as plugin

-card type with prefilled fields

-zooming picture instead of scrollbars?


* Memosyne analysis: Add-on package to do full custom statistical
analysis on the entire history of your learning process.
Status: initial code written, but clean up needed.

-add to svn
-document
-release
-research section on web site


* Miscellaneous:

-smarter sorting. See suggestios by larryrenslow

-natural sort order of categories which contain numbers (1 vs 01)

-auto identifying similar cards

-unify number shortcuts (with and without Ctrl)

-pop-up of context info

-forward / backward when previewing cards in the database

-clean up interval when importing from txt

-make file format strings translatable

-paste from clipboard

-preselect all in some text fields, so that the users can start typing
 immediately

-feedback about uploads in GUI / add time-out

-drag and drop of pictures, sound files

-autoupgrade, or at least notify of available upgrade (needs a separate thread)

-remember window size set by the user?

-bundle docs

-undo last grade + keyboard shortcut

-icon handling patch Dirk

-'teacher mode' on export, which allows pupils to update previously imported
 cards, as opposed to adding new cards. Implemented through id's of the form
 T.<fixed card id for all pupils>.<pupil user id>

-better sound replay support, through clicking on an icon

-integrate Mnemosyne analysis, advanced statistics, history,
 forgetting index, histogram of grades and intervals... (look at graphs
 in JMemorize)

-importing cards from rss feed

-clean obsolete latex images / autogenerate them

-investigate ridiculously large thinking times

-DTD for xml format

-priorities for categories?

-determine import / export file type based on suffix
 (i.e. remove file format field)? Probably not possible, as
 file dialogs only return filenames, not the chosen filter type.

-unify save and export?

-hints? separate mnemonics?

-corner case: If M > 0 and k < 0 then (a,b) is a local maximum
If M > 0 and k > 0 then (a,b) is a local minimum: eats < ... >

Far away:

-foreign language text widget, integrated with online dict,
 easy creation of new cards



* Plasma widget:

-Check Unicode

-set fonts, left align

-Allow clicking anywhere in the status window, rather than just on the
 text.

-Automatic detection of PyQt executable exit (bug in Superkaramba).
