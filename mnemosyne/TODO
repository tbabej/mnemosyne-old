Multiuser statistics analysis:

-card: 'old_log_format', Boolean) : only needed during upgrade in memory, 
or persistent for the full server
-break out card ids to a different table and use _id as well
-more times from a later start date to save space?
-sql: insert or ignore statement, faster if adding same data twice is no problem


Windows Mobile client:

If your phone has a touchscreen use the pocket pc version. Otherwise try the smartphone version. 

-better way of making default actions visible? Call layout()?
