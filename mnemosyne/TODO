Before 1.0:

-use QTextEdit instead of QLabel in main window

-new category in 'add items' is not reflected in drop-down box

-clicking cancel after 'merge and edit' *does* merge

-limited statistics

-html preview

-drag and drop of pictures

-resize back after expand

-check product tour for large fonts

-best way to selectively increase font size?

-per category statistics in 'Activate categories'?

-website:
  relative CSS layout
  better mailing list page
  contributors page

-graphics in software and on website




After 1.0:

-utf-8 txt import
-handle filenames in multiple encodings
-file(...).read().decode('utf-8') to check encoding of text file

-sounds (first external player, later gstreamer?)

-superkaramba / plasma

-mimetex for formulas

-statistics

-optimise for very large databases (http://www.equi4.com/metakit.html, 
  sql?)

-multiple categories per item, hierarchical categories

-feedback about uploads in GUI / add time-out

-automatic backups

-clean duplicates for answers too?

-colors?

-hints? separate mnemonics?

-back button?

-drop-down box in edit edits to show only items in a single category

-select multiple items to delete or change category

-make sure the same question isn't asked twice in row

-bug in Qt? : get rid of dummy '.' status tips

-bug in Qt? : shortcuts don't change back after changing 'show answer' 
 button text

-moving mem files back and forth between Linux and Windows suffers from CR/LF
 vs CR


Superkaramba:

- Check Unicode

- set fonts, left align

- Allow clicking anywhere in the status window, rather than just on the
  text.

- Automatic detection of PyQt executable exit (bug in Superkaramba).

- Check if we still need to be able to access the item by id as argument
  to the PyQt executable
