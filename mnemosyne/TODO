-recheck stats after weekend

-import plugin from file
-delete plugin
-rename to plugin manager in source and UI

-progress bars for long stats

-if the user has effectively used 'activate cards' once, and if he adds a new
 tag, ask if tag should be active. Always update the active set, and if the
 active set is also a saved set, update the saved set too. Different behaviour
 for subtags of existing tags? (Gnome)

 https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/953507

-card type clone: rename and delete, both in card browser and card type browser

-import from txt file (2 test cases from mac os	Naomi Borkowski)

-auto detect RTL http://dotancohen.com/howto/rtl_right_to_left.html (bug report)
-media sentence card has wrong color on win

-new cards with a >=2 grade can end up on the same day on first interactive rep
replace set_initial_grade by set_initial_grades(cards)? (Gnome, LP bug)
-also make sure this is OK when changing card type creates extra cards
-scheduler.spread_sister_cards?
-when learning late, related cards on the same day can happen

### RC1

-tell beta users to make sure to install latest beta first
-remove upgrade_beta_6.py, beta_7, etc... also in database

-errors in scripting engine related to main_widget

-make doc: errors related to _

-translations through website:
 https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/YourProject/Exports
-see if 1.x translations can be reused
-remove mnemosyne/pyqt_ui/locale

-upgrade website

## Waiting for PyQt fixes:

-https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-22883
-If something was fixed by upgrading to the new Qt, check if we need to install
 the old mnemosyne first in order to get these benefits. If so, enforce uninstall
 in installer?
-check sound with unicode, mail Barbara
-check 2 sound files again under W7, mail Patrick, update changelog

### Release

-don't refresh review widget after edit window if no changes have been made (gnome) (LP bug)
-after showing answer, exiting card browser hides answer again (Gnome, LP bug)
-try to avoid showing different card after exiting browser. Better reset_but_try_to_keep ...
taking grade 0/1 cards as well into account?

-Cntr+C in Q&A main does not work. (Gnome) (LP bug)
-Cntr+D shortcut in edit card doesn't work. (Gnome) (LP bug)
-starting the program when no cards are shownn does not draw a border around the
 Q field

-save tree state (which nodes are expanded or not) (Troy Guze)
QModelIndexList QAbstractItemModel::persistentIndexList () const
bool isExpanded ( const QModelIndex & index ) const

-after config change, tag label disappears (probably interaction with
 translation infrastructure)

-activate cards: 'having any of these tags:' is not aligned with tag with tag tree
-layout of "add clone" is not optimal under Windows
-splitters on XP are not visible
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2545577/qsplitter-becoming-undistinguishable-between-qwidget-and-qtabwidget

-if dialog like edit card or browse cards is open on server, try to close it when sync comes in  (+findChildren
QWidgetList list = QApplication::topLevelWidgets();
for (int i = 0; did_close && i < list.size(); ++i) {
w = list.at(i);
if (w->isVisible() && w->windowType() != Qt::Desktop) {
did_close = w->close();
list = QApplication::topLevelWidgets();
i = -1;

-remove TMP adding of default o_id in sync

widget will be centered on the main widget and not the activate cards dialog.

-py2exe: downloads 64 bit by default
-py2exe: download: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&displaylang=en

</ul>
-Qt bug? images in map card type sometimes hang

 The set should then be autoselected again.
-being able to edit existing set, replace input box by combobox with old sets

 event filter and slow everything down

-different translators for different users?

-integrate webserver in GUI, login mechanism, session_token, cookies
-add webserver in testsuite, case when the database is empty

 go from 'in large set' to 'not in small set'? Max time 0.6 secs, so perhaps not needed that much

-condition coverage
 http://lautaportti.wordpress.com/2011/05/07/test-coverage-analysis/

-have hierarchy in plugin names

-heising card type (radical, number of strokes)

-compression on backup to reduce write time to SD card?
-move from httplib to urllib2 to make use of automatic proxy detection? However, could have
 an impact on performance/streaming upload.

-'shared deck' export
-is 'client_info["shared_dack"] the best way to signal this? Or have entirely new
