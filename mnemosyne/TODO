* Create testsuite:

-create test for adding cards
-create test for detecting duplication
-pythoscope? http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pythoscope/0.2.1
http://pythoscope.org/

-regular expression search?

-add 'add card' option to deck manager?

-template expansion (disable add-vice-versa) ( both {../..} and {}..{})

-cloze deletion card type

-mnemosyne analysis as plugin

-remap keys as plugin

-active alert as plugin

-card type with prefilled fields

-zooming picture instead of scrollbars?


* Memosyne analysis: Add-on package to do full custom statistical
analysis on the entire history of your learning process.
Status: initial code written, but clean up needed.

-add to svn
-document
-release
-research section on web site


* Miscellaneous:

-sound recorder

-smarter sorting. See suggestios by larryrenslow

-natural sort order of categories which contain numbers (1 vs 01)

-auto identifying similar cards

-unify number shortcuts (with and without Ctrl)

-remember window size set by the user

-'teacher mode' on export, which allows pupils to update previously imported
 cards, as opposed to adding new cards. Implemented through id's of the form
 T.<fixed card id for all pupils>.<pupil user id>
