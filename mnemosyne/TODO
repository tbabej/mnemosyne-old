Superkaramba:

- Check Unicode

- set fonts, left align

- Allow clicking anywhere in the status window, rather than just on the
  text.

- Automatic detection of PyQt executable exit (bug in Superkaramba).

- Check if we still need to be able to access the item by id as argument
  to the PyQt executable
