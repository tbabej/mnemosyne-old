class CardType(Component, CompareOnId):

    """A card type groups a number of fact views on a certain fact, thereby
    forming a set of related cards.

    A card type needs an id as well as a name, because the name can change
    for different translations.

    Inherited card types should have ids where :: separates the different
    levels of the hierarchy, e.g. parent_id::child_id.
    
    The keys from the fact are also given more verbose names here, as well
    as an optional language code, e.g. for text-to-speech processing.
    This is not done in fact.py, on one hand to save space in the database,
    and on the other hand to allow the possibility that different card types
    give different names to the same key. (E.g. foreign word' could be
    called 'French' in a French card type, or 'pronunciation' could be
    called 'reading' in a Kanji card type.) This in done in self.fields,
    which is a list of the form [(fact_key, fact_key_name, language_code)].
    It is tempting to use a dictionary here, but we can't do that since
    ordering is important.

    Fields which need to be different for all facts belonging to this card
    type are listed in unique_fields.

    Note that a fact could contain more data than those listed in the card
    type's 'fields' variable, which could be useful for card types needing
    hidden fields.

    We could use the component manager to track fact views, but this is
    probably overkill.

    The function 'fact_data' typically just returns a dictionary which is
    typically just fact.data, butwhich can also be generated on the fly,
    as e.g. in the cloze card type.
    
    The functions 'create_related_cards' and 'edit_related_cards' can be
    overridden by card types which can have a varying number of fact views,
    e.g. the cloze card type.
