* Download and install PythonCE or PythonCE smartphone:

  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=104228

* Copy the directories ppygui and mnemosyne (containing libmnemosyne
  and ppygui_ui to \My Device\Program Files\Python25\Lib\site-packages

* Copy the updated version of the sqlite library sqlite3.dll
  (provided by tdhite) to \My Device\Program Files\Python25\
  You might need to activate 'Show All Files' in the filemanager menu
  for this

* Copy your .mnemosyne directory to your storage card, e.g. to
  \SDMMC\.mnemosyne

* Edit the basedir variable inside Mnemosyne Mobile.py to give 
  the location where your .mnemosyne directory will be stored. 
  In our example, this is \SDMMC\.mnemosyne

* Optionally, copy Mnemosyne Mobile.py to 
  \My Device\Windows\Start Menu\Programs for easier access. 

* The very first startup will be slower since all the code needs to be
  byte-compiled. This will only happen once.

* To synchronise your data with a desktop machine, it's best to
  synchronise the *entire* .mnemosyne directory, and not just your
  database (otherwise you will lose statistics information). There
  are external tools to make this easier (like Unison).
