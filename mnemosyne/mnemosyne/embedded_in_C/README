The files to study when writing a new client based on the embedded C server
are the following:

example_client.c: shows how to interact with libmnemosyne through C
main_wdgt.h, main_wdgt.c, review_wdgt.h, review_wdgt.c: these are the
    functions that libmnemosyne's UI controllers will call

The files above are now implemented in C, but could be implemented in any
language that allows linking to python_bridge.o and libpython.a, e.g.
ObjC.
